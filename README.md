1. [E-commerce App](https://e-commerce-app-29287.web.app):

My Role: Solo Developer

Description:
I spearheaded the development of a fully functional E-commerce app as a solo developer. The primary goal of the project was to apply and enhance my skills in React and Single Page Application (SPA) development. Leveraging HTML, CSS, and ReactJS, I implemented various features, including a responsive design, an authentication page, and seamless navigation using React Router DOM.

Technologies Used:

HTML/CSS/ReactJS
React Router DOM
Context API
Blurhash (for image placeholders)
Iconify (for icons)
Firebase (for storing products, blogs, and cart data)

Challenges:
While building the app, I encountered challenges in routing, managing actions, and optimizing performance. To overcome these hurdles, I implemented solutions such as using Blurhash for images, lazy loading for components, and optimizing image size to enhance overall application performance.

Achievements:
The project successfully demonstrated my ability to build a fully responsive and performant e-commerce application using a variety of technologies. Despite challenges in implementing authentication without a backend, I integrated Firebase to store essential data, showcasing adaptability in problem-solving.

Results:
The E-commerce app showcases my proficiency in frontend development, emphasizing clean code, responsiveness, and performance optimization. While the authentication aspect awaits backend integration, the project stands as a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and practical application of frontend technologies..
